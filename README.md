# LoginApplication
LoginApplication is a Spring Boot application that provides secure OAuth2 login functionality using Google. It allows users to authenticate via Google and access personalized profile information.

## Steps that I performed

- Create Resource Server, configured maven dependencies, application properties, spring security
- Utilized default spring security login page, created simple html profile and home page using thymeleaf
- Created test cases to test OAuth2 client functionality
- Output screenshots are placed in output folder
